    "## Background\n",
    "Soccer is the most popular game in the world. Played by billions of people, almost everyone has some knowledge of the game and their country's\n",
    "league. However, soccer is played differently throughout the world, with certain countries known for their flair and others known for their\n",
    "discipline. The goal of our project is to explore how these differences manifest themselves in data. The main data we will be working on is a\n",
    "collection of match results from eleven different European soccer leagues over a number of years (roughly 2010-2016). We will combine this data\n",
    "with information on player abilities, team play styles, and betting odds, to create insights into how these top leagues differ from one another. The\n",
    "infomation we create in this project could be used to aid the accuracy of a model used to predict soccer results.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "The first approach will be are winning and scoring patterns the same across different European soccer leagues?(home advantage, goals scored, variability of top teams each year).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second approach is the player and team attributes correlated with success according to FIFA soccer player data. By focusing on the physical characteristics of players who had a 90 or higher overall rating we have found out that the physical characteristic is not straight related to the win rate or player's overall rating. But it still has little correlation that can lead to the win rate or overall rating a little bit higher. By using linear regression as the tool to predict results we have found out that a player's height and weight play an important role in the soccer game. In other words, a player's physical characteristic is going to increase the win rate which means players with better physical data had a higher chance to win."

    "The match data is contains the home and away teams involved in the match, the goals scored by each team, and the result information. This data\n",

    "was collected via web scraping, as all of this infomation is readily availbale online, but needed to be collected and stored. The relevant population\n",
    "is the eleven leagues for which matches are recorded, all of which are in Europe. We will focus on the biggest leagues, being England, Spain and\n",
    "Italy. The scope of inference is small, if anything, because this data is years old. If this were up to date data, then our finding would have some\n",
    "bearing on how these leagues will perform going forward, but given that this data is at least five years old, the leagues would have had enough\n",
    "time to change that our finding will likely have little to no bearing on European soccer today.\n",
    "Data that we will pair with the match infomation is the player and team attributes, which are taken from Fifa, the most popular sports video game\n",
    "in the world. Fifa is a soccer video game which maticulously tracks player abilities and team styles throughout the year. While these stats are\n",

    "The exploratory analysis aimed at soccer players' physical characteristics and FIFA soccer player data. By applying data manipulation the dataset transferred to focus on the best player in FIFA against a real player's physical characteristics. Subsequently, multiple linear regression was performed, and learning the key features from the data to predict the overall rating by player's height and weight. Also, by applying principal components analysis to simplify datasets and determine the data features to demonstrate the result. In addition, data visualization was made to understand the data better.

The sterotype of soccer would be people thought only strong physical characteristic makes a good soccer player. In fact, physical characteristic doesn't play an important role of how player performs in soccer game. According to our dataset, different height had different strength which means some of the height are good at dribbling and some other will be good at free kick."
