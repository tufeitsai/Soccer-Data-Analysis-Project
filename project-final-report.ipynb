    "\n",
    "Soccer is an incredibly popular and complex sport. The motivation of this analysis is to gain insight on the top soccer leagues in Europe. This analysis has two aims. The first is to create metrics which summarize aspects of a soccer league and compare the relationships between these metrics among European soccer leagues. The second aim is to search for a relationship between players' physical attributes and players' overal ability through the use of Fifa stats. The results of our analysis show that there is little association between any physucal characteristic and overall ability. There is, however, an negative assocition between league goals per game and league competitiveness, and a positive association between league goals per game and the signifcance of home advantage."

    "## Background\n",
    "Soccer is the most popular game in the world. Played by billions of people, almost everyone has some knowledge of the game and their country's\n",
    "league. However, soccer is played differently throughout the world, with certain countries known for their flair and others known for their\n",
    "discipline. The goal of our project is to explore how these differences manifest themselves in data. The main data we will be working on is a\n",
    "collection of match results from eleven different European soccer leagues over a number of years (roughly 2010-2016). We will combine this data\n",
    "with information on player abilities, team play styles, and betting odds, to create insights into how these top leagues differ from one another. The\n",
    "infomation we create in this project could be used to aid the accuracy of a model used to predict soccer results.\n",

    "## Aims\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of the first approach was to find correlstions between metrics across Europe's top soccer leagues. The metrics created were league competitiveness, scoring rate, and significance of home advantage. Competitiveness was evaluated with two measurements: the number of unique teams finishing in top 4 positions, and the average spread of points per game over all season. Significance of home advantage was evaluated with two measurements, as well. The first being the average difference between goal difference at home and goal difference away from home. The second being the avgerage difference between points per game at home and points per game away from home. The third metric is the scoring rate in each league, which is an average of goals per game over all seasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second approach is the player and team attributes correlated with success according to FIFA soccer player data. By focusing on the physical characteristics of players who had a 90 or higher overall rating we have found out that the physical characteristic is not straight related to the win rate or player's overall rating. But it still has little correlation that can lead to the win rate or overall rating a little bit higher. By using linear regression as the tool to predict results we have found out that a player's height and weight play an important role in the soccer game. In other words, a player's physical characteristic is going to increase the win rate which means players with better physical data had a higher chance to win."

    "is the eleven leagues for which matches are recorded, all of which are in Europe. We will focus on the biggest leagues, being England, Spain and\n",

    "\n",
    "The exploratory analysis aimed at soccer players' physical characteristics and FIFA soccer player data. By applying data manipulation the dataset transferred to focus on the best player in FIFA against a real player's physical characteristics. Subsequently, multiple linear regression was performed, and learning the key features from the data to predict the overall rating by player's height and weight. Also, by applying principal components analysis to simplify datasets and determine the data features to demonstrate the result. In addition, data visualization was made to understand the data better. (Data visualization package Altair was used).\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis on league metrics began with a lot of exploratory analysis and data manipulation. The exploratory analysis lead me to chose the metrics that would be involved in the correlation matrix. Again, the metrics are competativeness, scoring rate, and signifcance of home advantage. These metrics were calculated using aggreation methods in Pandas and were visualized using Altair. Once metrics were calculated for each league, the correlation between each measuremnt was found, and visualized with a heatmap to highlight positive an dnegative relationships."

    "This section aims to visualize the comparison of competition levels and the distribution of talent amogst teams in Europe's top soccer leagues. \n",
    "\n",
    "Competitivenss is first measured by the number of different teams which have finished in the top 4 positions in each league during this time period. A greater number of unique top 4 finishers indicates a league in which success (ie. talent) is widely distributed across a greater number of teams, and hence indicates a more competitive league. The second metric used to assess league competitiveness is the standard deviation of points in each leagues final standing for each season. In this way, a league with closely grouped teams suggest a competitive league, whereas a league that is dominated by the top teams (a two or three horse race) would be indicative of a league with low competition levels.\n",

    "By applying multiple linear regression has demonstrated that the height is one of the factor that will influence the overall rating for soccer players. After using linear regression model to train with data features we found that certain height are having larger amount of high overall rating than others. The actual rating system had a major curve between 182cm to 187cm and the linear regression model had a small curve with the same height. In other words, it demonstrates that player's height will influence their rating. The purpose of doing this is because we understand that there are many other elements that will affect the rating. However, when using linear regression we only focus on the data and data features which means by only looking at player's height we found out that certain height of people always perform better than others.\n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "The correaltion matrix highlights some interesting relationships in Europe's top soccer leagues.\n",
    "\n",
    "One signifcant finding is the relationship between league competitiveness and league goals per game. Goals per game is apparently negatively associated with league competitiveness. Meaning, an increase in goals per game leads to a decrease in the number of unique top 4 teams, and an increase in the spread of points per game. Therefore, this analysis shows that higher scoring leagues will tended to have a more unequal distribution of talent and success among teams in this period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting finding is that, while the association between home advantage in terms of points per game and goals per game is not particularly strong, the association between home advatage in terms of goal difference and goals per game is significant. This suggests that goals per game is positively associated with a significant home advantage. In other words, the leagues in which home advantage made a big difference tended to be the higher scoring leagues. This may be because home advantage manifests itself more when teams are scoring 2 or 3 goals per game, rather than fighting out 0-0 draws.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is not a particularly strong correlation between home advantage and league competitiveness, but this analysis suggests that home advantage will be slightly more significant among competitive leagues. Which makes sense, becuase it doesn't matter where the match is played if one team is far more talented than the other. One could expect home advantage to have a more significant effect if the involved teams are otherwise evenly matched.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to our dataset, different heights had different advantages which means some of the heights are good at dribbling and some others will be good at free-kick, or passing. Because a soccer game is based on the whole team that means not only the player who got the goal performs well. Good defense and good passing also play an important role in the soccer game. Besides, if we focus on the player's height in certain positions we can figure out a better physical characteristic that has a better overall rating. In other words, if we go deeper to compare all the data on the same position we can find out what is the best physical characteristic for each position. In conclusion, we will be able to predict the overall rating by looking at the player's physical characteristics in each position."
